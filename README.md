# Simple-CSS-Template

My own proposal of CSS start template.

# What's Inside

-   First of All a google font import
-   A Table Of Content
-   Some CSS Variables (like colors and font for examples)
-   Start with a modern Reset
-   And let's get into it. Separated in category like block, inline, class and ID

Feel free to modify it as you wish and to bring your comments so that I can improve it in my turn.

_PS : My advice is to sort all tags in alphabetical order, or sort of your choice. Then maybe make some ctrl+F search in case._
